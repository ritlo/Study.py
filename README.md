# Study.py
Simple script I wrote to help me concentrate while studying from PDFs. Auto scrolls PDFs and uses text to speech to indicate the amount of time that has passed.

Requires the pyttsx3 and keyboard libraries, which can be installed by running the following 

`pip install pyttsx3`

`pip install keyboard`
